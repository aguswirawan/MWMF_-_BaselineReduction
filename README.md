On this github, there are three types of code for the application of the MWMF method and three methods of baseline reduction.
  The first type code is used to apply the MWMF method and the three baseline reduction methods to the DEAP dataset.
  The second type code is used to apply the MWMF method and the three baseline reduction methods to the DREAMER Dataset.
  The third type code is used to apply the MWMF method and the three baseline reduction methods on the AMIGOS Dataset.
In addition to several code files, there are several .xls files that contain the average accuracy results of each participant for twenty-four test scenarios on three datasets (DEAP, DREAMER, and AMIGOS).
